                    The first step in understanding how to position elements is to understand the
                    fundamental model of CSS-the box model.
                </p>
                <h2>The Box Model</h2>
                <p>
                    Every element you place on a page creates a box. You cannot always see the
                    boundaries and the borders of the boxes you create, nut the boxes are there. A <i>div</i>
                    element creaes a box, as do <i>h1</i>, <i>img</i>, <i>span</i>, and <i>td</i> elements. <br>
                    Each box has properties you can set with CSS. I've illustrated some of these properties in Figure 1.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Figure 1 Border, padding, and margin</h4>
                The <i>padding</i> of a box is the distance between the content of the box and the box's 
                border, and the <i>margin</i> is the distancebetween a box and any adjacent element. In 
                other words, padding adds space inside the border, while a margin adds space outside 
                the border. In the following CSS, I set both the padding and the margin to a distance of 
                10 pixels. This is why you can see so much white space in Figure1. 
                <br><br>
                The border surrounding every element is not visible by default, but by using CSS I can 
                change the color of an element's border, as well as the thickness and line style the 
                browser uses when drawing the border. What you see in Figure 1 is the result of a style 
                rule telling the browser to draw a solid, thin red line around the box that each div 
                element creates.
            </div>
